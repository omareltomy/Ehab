// Before writing any code try to think how will you approach this problem and what tools will you use
// Identify the inputs and outputs
// Identify the different scenarios and outputs
// break the big problem into smaller problems
// Think how will you approach the problem using code
// Use Pseudo code to help you visualize the solution
// try to trace it line by line and think what it would output if you run it
// when you are confident that you found the solution, write it and test

// create an array of names that should contain the test data
// check if the last name is = "x"
// if it is remove it from the array
// if it's not then console.log all the names in the array

// test data = ["Ahmed", "Mohamed", "Omar", "Ehab", "Amr"]

// scenario input = "Amr" -> the function should remove it from the array
// scenario input = "Ehab" -> output "Ahmed, Mohammed, Omar, Ehab, Amr
